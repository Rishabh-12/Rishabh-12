ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Rishabh, a 16-year-old aspiring developer and creative enthusiast. Passionate about technology and creativity, I enjoy exploring various domains of software development and digital media.

ðŸŒŸ Skills:

App Making (Beginner): I've dipped my toes into the world of app development, tinkering with tools like android studio.
Python (Intermediate): Python is my go-to language for problem-solving and automation. I've built several projects and scripts using Python, from web scraping to data analysis.
Web Development (Between Beginner and Intermediate): While still honing my skills, I've ventured into web development, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring my ideas to life.
Graphic Design and Video Editing (Intermediate): I have a knack for visual storytelling and have been exploring graphic design and video editing. I love experimenting with Adobe after effects and other tools to create engaging content.

ðŸš€ Projects:

The app enables sending messages to update traffic conditions and includes a feature to convey patient status, enhancing response coordination and efficiency during emergencies.
Unit-coverter-app:- This app was created by me as an introductory project to explore the functionality of Android Studio. Designed to convert kilograms to pounds accurately.
